# aSimpleExpressApp

This is a simple app built with `express` that shows the episodes of the American series Silicon Valley.

## My approach

I created a express app from scratch and I used Chai and Mocha for the tests.


## Instructions

Prerequisites
node installed

- to run the web app

```sh
clone the repo:
$ git clone https://github.com/GiadaSimonetti/aSimpleExpressApp

change directory:
  $ cd aSimpleExpressApp

install dependencies:
  $ npm install

run the app:
  $ node app.js

go to
  $ http://localhost:3000/episodes

```

- to run the tests
(only while the server is not running)

```sh

npm test

```
